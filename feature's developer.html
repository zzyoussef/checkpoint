               My name is youssef zaibet,
               i'm a student in 9 avril highschool, Second grade science ,i'm currently learning wed development in gomycode After completing the game development and Python courses.

                <h2>What is HTML?</h2> 
                Think of a document that you would create in a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs. They usually consist of more than one style.

                They use different font sizes to indicate different sections of the text, like headers, body paragraphs, footers, table of contents, captions, and so on.

                Unlike humans who can simply look at a document and understand the difference between a heading and a paragraph, computers don’t have that intuition. In order to correctly render a web page, it must be explicitly told what each piece of content is.

                So how exactly do we instruct the browser to display web content? This is where Hypertext Markup Language (or HTML for short) can come in handy.

                HTML is the language that most websites are written with. It is used to create web pages and ensure their functionality.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hypertext:</b> defines the link between the web pages.</li>
                    <li><b>Markup language:</b> is used to define the text document within a tag, which determines the structure of web pages.</li>
                </ul>
                HTML allows you to take a plain text document created in any simple text editor and organize it into lists. It also creates links to other web pages, includes images, and much more.

                So in other words, HTML outlines the structure or the skeleton of our web page using tags.

                Just like most programming languages, we type a bunch of HTML into a file (a.k.a. document) so we can send it around.

                HTML documents are files that end with a .html or .htm extension. You can view them using any web browser (such as Google Chrome, Safari, or Mozilla Firefox). The browser reads the HTML file and renders its content so that internet users can view it.

                The only thing that we have to do is to change the file extension into .html

                <h2>HTML Code Structure:</h2>
                As we have seen, HTML is based on tags (<>).

                We have to know that:
                <ul>
                    <li>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.</li>
                    <li>The HTML document itself begins with < html > and ends with </ html>.</li>
                    <li>The visible part of the HTML document is between < body > and </body >.</li>
                    <li>A tag is closed this way: </ tagname>. For example, < head > is closed with < /head >.</li>
                    <li>Changes are held between tags (For example, the code between < b > and < /b > becomes bold.</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
        <a name="resume"></a>
            <h2>resume:</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        imagine you're crafting a document; HTML lets you specify whether a certain part is a heading, 
                        a paragraph, an image, a link, or any other type of content. Each tag serves as an instruction to 
                        the browser on how to display that particular element. It's the language browsers understand to render text, 
                        images, links, and more.
